I created a variaion of the game snake where the objective is to eat the smaller blue circle while avoiding the bigger blue circle (poisonous food) 
and with dealing with your snake speed slowly increasing as your score gets higher.

HOW TO PLAY:
1. Use the arrow keys to move your snake around. 
2. Objective is to eat the smaller blue circle and avoid the slightly bigger one (because it is poisonous)
3. Try to reach the highest score as your snake will gain speed the higher score you obtain.
